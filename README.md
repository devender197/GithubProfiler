# GithubProfiler

This is a basic SwiftUI application for iOS.

## Overview

The application is built using Swift and the SwiftUI framework. Currently, it serves as a minimal example and displays a "Hello, world!" message along with a globe icon on the main screen.

## Features

As of now, the application has the following basic structure:

- **Main Application File**: `GithubProfilerApp.swift` (sets up the app's lifecycle)
- **Main View**: `ContentView.swift` (defines the UI displayed to the user)

Currently, there are no advanced features or API integrations implemented.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- macOS with Xcode installed.

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2.  **Open the project in Xcode**:
    Navigate to the project directory and open the `GithubProfiler.xcodeproj` file.
    ```bash
    cd path/to/GithubProfiler
    open GithubProfiler.xcodeproj
    ```
3.  **Select a simulator or device**:
    In Xcode, choose an iOS simulator (e.g., iPhone 15 Pro) or connect a physical iOS device.
4.  **Run the application**:
    Click the "Play" button (or press `Cmd+R`) in Xcode to build and run the application on the selected simulator or device.

## API Description

## Testing

The project includes placeholder unit tests (`GithubProfilerTests/GithubProfilerTests.swift`) and UI tests (`GithubProfilerUITests/GithubProfilerUITests.swift`). These can be expanded to include specific tests as features are added.

To run tests:
1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Go to **Product > Test** (or press `Cmd+U`).
